/**
 * Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.
 * <p>
 * Machine 1 (sender) has the function:
 * <p>
 * string encode(vector<string> strs) {
 * // ... your code
 * return encoded_string;
 * }
 * Machine 2 (receiver) has the function:
 * vector<string> decode(string s) {
 * //... your code
 * return strs;
 * }
 * So Machine 1 does:
 * <p>
 * string encoded_string = encode(strs);
 * and Machine 2 does:
 * <p>
 * vector<string> strs2 = decode(encoded_string);
 * strs2 in Machine 2 should be the same as strs in Machine 1.
 * <p>
 * Implement the encode and decode methods.
 * <p>
 * Â 
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * The string may contain any possible characters out of 256 valid ascii characters. Your algorithm should be generalized enough to work on any possible characters.
 * Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.
 * Do not rely on any library method such as eval or serialize methods. You should implement your own encode/decode algorithm.
