/**
 * Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.
 * <p>
 * For each node at position (X, Y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (X+1, Y-1).
 * <p>
 * Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).
 * <p>
 * If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.
 * <p>
 * Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.
