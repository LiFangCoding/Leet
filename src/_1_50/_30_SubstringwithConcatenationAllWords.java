/**
 * You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "barfoothefoobarman",
 * words = ["foo","bar"]
 * Output: [0,9]
 * Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
 * The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
 * words = ["word","good","best","word"]
 * Output: []
